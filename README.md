# CyProjects
Hello and welcome to my current Project.
the project was the final task to graduate from john bryce and receive their diploma.
i Hope you enjoy and Learn from this code more about me.
its still on its alpha state so things can be challenging in running it.
MAKE SURE YOU READ the PDF file first till the END! its verry important and explains alot about the code.
MAKE SURE you have VT - API KEY to run the code properly. simple open the file with nano/geany/vim whatever comfortable and add it on LINE 133.
the file designed to run on kali linux's temp folder and might delete existing files thats located there so make sure you dont have there important stuff.
as said above its still in alpha state so RUNNING THE CODE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. basicly putting it here to share my knowledge.
